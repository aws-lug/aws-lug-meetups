# aws-lug-meetups
Repo for all things related to the AWS User Group Liverpool

## Ways of Working
We are intending the repo and broader GitHub tooling to provide a transparent way of communicating the organisers intentions and the communities goals. This is intended as a start to allow the group as a whole to help direct the way the meetings are run. 
This is a first attempt at outlining our tooling and approach. Feel free to raise a PR and suggest any changes you think would help.

### Issues

Please use Github Issues for this Repo to add any actions or point of interest you would like to bring to the group attention. For instance feedback around parking or content of a session.

### Discussions 

Please use Github Discussions for any topics for broader community engagement. For Example options for venue, topics for conversation 

### Projects

We have setup a project in a Kanban style to openly show progress on some the tasks the organisers are working on.
